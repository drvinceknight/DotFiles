# My dotfiles

This repo contains my dot files and some scripts to set them up.

## vimrc

Currently there is one vimrc in this repository: in the simple subdirectory. This just sets up some key mappings (leader + l for latexmk etc) and sets some basic settings (no swp files, line numbers etc).

## Setup script

This repo contains a python script that creates symbolic links as required. Run `./setup.py -h` for info.
